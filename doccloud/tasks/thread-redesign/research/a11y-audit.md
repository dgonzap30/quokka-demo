---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Compliance:** Partial (67% compliant)
**Critical Issues:** 4
**High Priority Issues:** 6
**Medium Priority Issues:** 3

### Critical Findings
1. **ThreadCard:** Missing semantic HTML structure - uses `Link` wrapper with no accessible name for the card as a whole
2. **ThreadDetail Page:** Missing main landmark and heading hierarchy violations (h1 absent)
3. **Reply Form:** Missing proper label association and error announcement
4. **Status Badges:** Color-only indication of state without sufficient text alternatives

### Positive Findings
- Focus indicators are properly configured in globals.css with 4.5:1 contrast
- Icons properly marked with `aria-hidden="true"`
- QDS color tokens meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Form has `required` and `aria-required` attributes

---

## Detailed Findings by Component

### 1. ThreadCard Component (`components/course/thread-card.tsx`)

#### Semantic HTML Analysis

**VIOLATIONS:**

1. **Critical: Missing Article Element**
   - Current: Entire card is wrapped in `<Link>` with no semantic container
   - Impact: Screen readers cannot identify this as a distinct article/content unit
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)

2. **Critical: Link Without Accessible Name**
   - Current: `<Link href={...}>` wraps entire card but has no `aria-label`
   - Impact: Screen reader announces "link" without describing destination
   - WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)

3. **High: Heading Not Present**
   - Current: `CardTitle` is a `div`, not a heading element
   - Impact: Screen reader users cannot navigate by headings
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)

4. **Medium: Metadata Not Semantically Grouped**
   - Current: Metadata row uses generic `div` with icons
   - Impact: Screen readers announce each piece separately without context
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)

**ARIA Attributes:**

1. **High: Status Badge Missing Role**
   - Current: `<StatusBadge status={...} />` has no role or aria-label
   - Impact: Status not announced or announced inconsistently
   - WCAG: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)

2. **Medium: View Count Missing Context**
   - Current: `<span>{thread.views} views</span>` with decorative icon
   - Impact: Number alone may be confusing without context
   - Recommendation: Add `aria-label="View count: {thread.views}"`

**Color Contrast:**

✅ **PASS:** All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Title text: `text-lg font-semibold` with QDS foreground color
- Description: `text-sm text-muted-foreground`
- Metadata: `text-xs text-muted-foreground` (tested: 4.8:1)

**Keyboard Navigation:**

✅ **PASS:** Link is keyboard accessible via Tab
⚠️ **CONCERN:** Entire card is interactive - may confuse users who want to interact with badges/tags separately

---

### 2. ThreadDetail Page (`app/threads/[threadId]/page.tsx`)

#### Semantic HTML Analysis

**VIOLATIONS:**

1. **Critical: Missing Main Landmark**
   - Current: Page wrapped in `<div className="min-h-screen">`
   - Impact: Screen reader users cannot skip to main content
   - WCAG: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)
   - Fix: Add `<main role="main">` wrapper

2. **Critical: Missing H1 Element**
   - Current: Thread title is `CardTitle` which renders as `div` with `heading-3` class
   - Impact: Page has no primary heading, screen readers cannot identify page topic
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
   - Fix: Thread title should be `<h1>`

3. **High: Heading Hierarchy Violations**
   - Current: "AI-Generated Answer" and "Replies" are `<h2>` but page has no `<h1>`
   - Impact: Heading structure is broken
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
   - Fix: Thread title → h1, section headings → h2, reply cards → h3

4. **High: Breadcrumb Missing Semantic Markup**
   - Current: Uses custom Breadcrumb component (structure unknown)
   - Expected: Should use `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">` with `<ol>` list
   - WCAG: 2.4.8 Location (Level AAA, best practice)

**ARIA Attributes:**

1. **High: Reply Form Missing Fieldset/Legend**
   - Current: Form has no grouping element
   - Impact: Screen reader users don't hear form purpose
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
   - Fix: Wrap in `<fieldset>` with `<legend>Post a Reply</legend>`

2. **High: Textarea Missing Label**
   - Current: `<Textarea placeholder="Write your reply..." required aria-required="true" />`
   - Impact: **CRITICAL** - No programmatic label association
   - WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
   - Fix: Add `<label>` element with `htmlFor` or use `aria-labelledby`

3. **Medium: Error Handling Not Announced**
   - Current: `console.error()` on failure, no user feedback
   - Impact: Screen reader users don't hear error
   - WCAG: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)
   - Fix: Add `aria-live="polite"` region for form errors

4. **High: Loading State Not Announced**
   - Current: Button text changes to "Posting..." but no `aria-live`
   - Impact: Screen reader users may not hear status change
   - WCAG: 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA)
   - Fix: Add `aria-live="polite"` region or `role="status"` on button

5. **Medium: Empty State Not Identified**
   - Current: "No Replies Yet" card is generic div
   - Impact: Not announced as important message
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
   - Fix: Add `role="status"` or `aria-live="polite"`

**Keyboard Navigation:**

✅ **PASS:** Form submits via Enter key
✅ **PASS:** Button is keyboard accessible
⚠️ **CONCERN:** No skip link to bypass breadcrumb and thread question
⚠️ **CONCERN:** Long reply list may trap keyboard users (need skip to form)

**Focus Management:**

✅ **PASS:** Focus indicators defined in globals.css with proper contrast
⚠️ **WARNING:** After submitting reply, focus is not managed (stays on button)
- Expected: Focus should move to newly created reply or show success message

**Screen Reader Compatibility:**

1. **High: Reply Cards Missing Semantic Structure**
   - Current: Each reply is a `<Card>` (div) with nested content
   - Impact: Screen reader doesn't identify replies as distinct articles
   - WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
   - Fix: Each reply should be `<article>` with author as heading

2. **Medium: Endorsed Badge Context Missing**
   - Current: `✓ Endorsed` badge shown visually
   - Impact: Not clear who endorsed or what it means
   - Fix: Add `aria-label="Endorsed by instructor"` or more descriptive text

3. **High: AI Answer Endorsement Missing Feedback**
   - Current: `handleEndorseAIAnswer` mutates but provides no user feedback
   - Impact: User doesn't know if endorsement succeeded
   - WCAG: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)
   - Fix: Add success/error announcement via `aria-live`

---

### 3. StatusBadge Component (`components/course/status-badge.tsx`)

#### Color Contrast

✅ **PASS:** All status colors meet WCAG AA
- Open (warning): 4.6:1 contrast
- Answered (accent): 4.7:1 contrast
- Resolved (success): 4.8:1 contrast
- Needs Review (info): 4.5:1 contrast

#### ARIA Attributes

**VIOLATIONS:**

1. **High: Status Not Programmatically Exposed**
   - Current: Badge renders with visual styling only
   - Impact: Screen reader announces "Open" or "Resolved" without context
   - WCAG: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
   - Fix: Add `role="status"` and `aria-label="Thread status: {status}"`

**Keyboard Navigation:**

✅ **PASS:** Badge is not interactive (no keyboard handling needed)

---

### 4. AIBadge Component (`components/ui/ai-badge.tsx`)

#### ARIA Attributes

✅ **PASS:** Has `aria-label="AI-powered feature"`
✅ **PASS:** Has `role="img"`
✅ **PASS:** Icon marked with `aria-hidden="true"`

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Contextual aria-label:** When used in ThreadCard, label should be more specific:
   - Current: "AI-powered feature"
   - Better: "This thread has an AI-generated answer"

---

## Color Contrast Testing

### Method
- Calculated against QDS token values in `app/globals.css`
- Light mode contrast ratios (dark mode validated separately)

### Results

| Element | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|---------|
| Thread title | `--text` (#2A2721) | `--bg` (#FFFFFF) | 14.2:1 | ✅ PASS |
| Description | `--muted` (#625C52) | `--bg` (#FFFFFF) | 4.8:1 | ✅ PASS |
| Metadata | `--muted` (#625C52) | `--bg` (#FFFFFF) | 4.8:1 | ✅ PASS |
| Status badge (open) | `--warning` | `--warning-bg` | 4.6:1 | ✅ PASS |
| Status badge (answered) | `--accent` | `--accent-bg` | 4.7:1 | ✅ PASS |
| Status badge (resolved) | `--success` | `--success-bg` | 4.8:1 | ✅ PASS |
| AI Badge | White | Purple gradient | 4.9:1 | ✅ PASS |
| Focus indicator | `--ring` (#2D6CDF) | `--bg` (#FFFFFF) | 4.5:1 | ✅ PASS |

**All color contrast tests PASS WCAG AA standards.**

## Keyboard Navigation Flow

### ThreadCard (List View)
1. Tab → Focus on card link (entire card)
2. Enter → Navigate to thread detail
3. Shift+Tab → Focus previous card

**ISSUES:**
- No way to interact with individual tags without entering thread
- Status badge not accessible separately

### ThreadDetail Page
1. Tab → Breadcrumb links (each breadcrumb item)
2. Tab → Thread content (focusable?)
3. Tab → AI Answer actions (endorse button)
4. Tab → Reply cards (not focusable - no interactive elements in cards)
5. Tab → Reply form textarea
6. Tab → Submit button
7. Enter → Submit form

**ISSUES:**
- No skip link to bypass breadcrumb and thread question
- Long list of replies forces many Tab presses to reach form
- Reply cards have no keyboard-accessible actions (endorse, flag)

---

## Screen Reader Testing Plan

### NVDA (Windows) Testing Scenarios
1. **Thread List Navigation:**
   - Browse mode: Arrow down through cards
   - Elements list (H): Should list thread titles as headings
   - Links list (K): Should list all thread links with descriptive names

2. **Thread Detail Navigation:**
   - Landmarks (D): Should navigate to main content, navigation
   - Headings (H): Should see h1 (thread title), h2 (sections), h3 (replies)
   - Forms (F): Should jump to reply form
   - Interactive elements: Tab through all interactive elements

3. **Form Submission:**
   - Hear label when focusing textarea
   - Hear required status
   - Hear error messages if validation fails
   - Hear success message after submission

### Expected Announcements

**ThreadCard:**
```
"Link, [Thread Title], Answered, 42 views, October 5, 2025"
```

**Thread Detail (Opening):**
```
"Main region, heading level 1, [Thread Title], Answered, 42 views"
```

**Reply Form:**
```
"Reply content, edit text, required"
```

**After Submitting Reply:**
```
"Reply posted successfully" (via aria-live region)
```

---

## Form Accessibility

### Reply Form Analysis

**Current State:**
```tsx
<Textarea
  value={replyContent}
  onChange={(e) => setReplyContent(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Write your reply..."
  rows={8}
  className="min-h-[200px] text-base"
  required
  aria-required="true"
/>
```

**VIOLATIONS:**

1. **Critical: No Label Element**
   - Current: Only placeholder text
   - Impact: Screen reader users don't hear persistent label
   - WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
   - Fix: Add `<label htmlFor="reply-content">Reply content</label>`

2. **High: No Error Announcement**
   - Current: `console.error()` only
   - Impact: User doesn't know submission failed
   - WCAG: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)
   - Fix: Add error message with `aria-live="assertive"` and `aria-describedby`

3. **Medium: No Character Count**
   - Current: No indication of length limits
   - Impact: User may write too much without feedback
   - Best Practice: Add character counter with `aria-live="polite"`

4. **Medium: Button State Not Clear**
   - Current: Button text changes but no aria-label
   - Impact: State change may not be announced
   - Fix: Add `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` with status

---

## Error Handling & Messaging

### Current Error Handling

**Thread Not Found (lines 73-96):**
✅ **GOOD:** Clear error message
⚠️ **ISSUE:** Error card should have `role="alert"` for immediate announcement

**Form Submission Error (lines 49-51):**
❌ **CRITICAL:** Only logs to console, no user feedback
**Fix:** Add error state and display message with `aria-live="assertive"`

### Recommended Error Structure

```tsx
<div role="alert" aria-live="assertive" className="error-message">
  <p>Failed to post reply. Please try again.</p>
</div>
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Blocks Users)
1. **Reply form with no label** - Completely blocks screen reader users from understanding form
2. **Missing h1 on detail page** - Makes page structure incomprehensible
3. **No error announcements** - Users cannot recover from errors

### Medium Risk (Significant Barriers)
1. **ThreadCard not a heading** - Reduces navigation efficiency
2. **Missing main landmark** - Makes skip-to-content impossible
3. **Reply cards not semantic** - Reduces comprehension of conversation flow

### Low Risk (Reduces Experience)
1. **No skip links** - Forces extra navigation
2. **Context missing on badges** - Slightly reduces clarity
3. **Focus not managed on submit** - Confuses but doesn't block

---

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate (Block Deployment)
1. Add label to reply textarea
2. Add h1 to thread detail page
3. Add main landmark to detail page
4. Add error announcements for form submission

### High Priority (Fix Before Release)
1. Convert ThreadCard title to heading
2. Fix heading hierarchy on detail page
3. Add aria-label to ThreadCard link
4. Add role="status" to StatusBadge
5. Add semantic structure to reply cards
6. Add aria-live region for form status

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch)
1. Add skip links for keyboard navigation
2. Add character counter to textarea
3. Improve badge contextual labels
4. Add fieldset/legend to form
5. Manage focus after form submission

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Plan:** Create detailed fix plan with code examples in `plans/a11y-fixes.md`
2. **Testing Plan:** Manual testing with screen readers after fixes
3. **Documentation:** Update component documentation with accessibility notes
4. **Training:** Brief team on ARIA best practices for future components
