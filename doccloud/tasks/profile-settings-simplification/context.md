# Profile & Settings Simplification - Task Context

**Created:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Goal

Simplify the ProfileSettingsDropdown and create dedicated profile and settings pages for a more professional, streamlined user experience.

---

## In-Scope

**Modal Simplification:**
- Remove Dashboard link from Profile tab
- Remove Quokka Points section from modal
- Reduce modal width (w-80 â†’ w-64)
- Simplify Profile tab to just show user info + links

**Profile Page:**
- Create `/profile` route with full profile view
- Display user info, avatar, role, stats
- Add "View Profile" link in Profile tab

**Settings Pages:**
- `/settings` - main settings hub
- `/settings/notifications` - notification preferences
- `/settings/appearance` - theme and display
- `/settings/privacy` - privacy controls
- `/settings/help` - help & support

**Icon Simplification:**
- Use more professional icon (CircleUser or similar)

---

## Out-of-Scope

- User profile editing functionality (display-only for now)
- Complex settings logic (basic structure only)
- Backend integration
