# Task: Navigation Back Button for Points and Support Pages

**Goal:** Add browser-history-aware back navigation to `/points` and `/support` pages so users can easily return to the previous page (especially from course contexts).

**In-Scope:**
- Create reusable `BackButton` component following QDS design system
- Add back navigation to `/points` page
- Add back navigation to `/support` page
- Optionally refactor `/ask` page to use new BackButton component
- Ensure WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Backend changes (frontend-only)
- Navigation header modifications
- Global navigation system changes
- Cookie/localStorage-based navigation tracking

**Done When:**
- [x] All routes render without console errors in prod build
- [x] a11y: keyboard nav + focus ring visible + AA contrast
- [x] Responsive at 360/768/1024/1280
- [x] Types pass (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [x] Lint clean (`npm run lint`)
- [x] Back button visible on points page with proper navigation
- [x] Back button visible on support page with proper navigation
- [x] `router.back()` navigates to previous page in browser history
- [x] Fallback to dashboard if no history available
- [x] QDS-compliant styling throughout

## Constraints

1. Frontend-only scope
2. No breaking changes to mock API
3. QDS compliance (tokens, spacing, radius, shadows)
4. Type safety (no `any`)
5. Component reusability (props-driven)
6. Must work with browser history navigation
7. WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility minimum

---

## Decisions

1. **Component Architecture** (`components/navigation/back-button.tsx`)
   - ✅ Created reusable BackButton component instead of duplicating code
   - ✅ Follows existing pattern from `/ask` page (uses `router.back()`)
   - ✅ Props-driven design with fallback href support (defaults to `/dashboard`)
   - Related files: `app/points/page.tsx`, `app/support/page.tsx`

2. **Navigation Pattern** (Browser History)
   - ✅ Uses Next.js router.back() to respect browser navigation history
   - ✅ Fallback to `/dashboard` if no browser history (window.history.length > 1 check)
   - Rationale: More intuitive UX, follows web standards, simple implementation

3. **Visual Design** (QDS-compliant)
   - ✅ ChevronLeft icon from Lucide React
   - ✅ Glass panel styling with backdrop blur
   - ✅ Hover effects: scale + shadow + border color transition
   - ✅ Focus states: visible ring with accent/60 color
   - ✅ WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (min touch target 44px, keyboard nav, ARIA labels)

4. **Integration Approach**
   - ✅ Added BackButton at top of content area on both pages
   - ✅ Positioned before hero sections for visual consistency
   - ✅ No changes needed to `/ask` page (different UX context - form vs page)
   - Rationale: Consistent placement, doesn't disrupt existing layouts

## Risks & Rollback

**Risks:**
- `router.back()` might navigate to unexpected pages if user has complex navigation history
- Component might not visually match existing patterns
- Accessibility issues if not properly tested

**Rollback:**
- Revert commits for BackButton component
- Remove imports from points/support pages
- Restore previous page state
- Simple, low-risk change with clear boundaries
