# Task: Auth & Role-Based Dashboard System

**Goal:** Build comprehensive authentication flow with separate student and instructor dashboards, move Q&A and AI features into course context with floating Quokka agent

**In-Scope:**
- Role-based login experience (student vs instructor clear separation)
- Student dashboard (`/dashboard`) - course overview, recent activity, insights
- Instructor dashboard (`/dashboard`) - course management, metrics, moderation tools  
- Course-specific Ask Question functionality (moved from global `/ask`)
- Floating Quokka AI agent within course context (replaces global `/quokka`)
- Role-specific navigation and UI elements
- Update routing: `/` → `/login` → `/dashboard` → `/courses/[id]`

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Real authentication/backend
- TA-specific dashboard (use instructor dashboard for TAs)
- Course creation/editing
- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Real-time notifications

**Done When:**
- [ ] Login page shows clear student/instructor login options
- [ ] Student dashboard shows: enrolled courses, recent activity, unread notifications
- [ ] Instructor dashboard shows: managed courses, metrics, unanswered threads queue
- [ ] Ask Question moved into course detail page
- [ ] Floating Quokka AI agent appears in course context (bottom-right)
- [ ] Navigation reflects role-based features
- [ ] All routes render without console errors in prod build
- [ ] a11y: keyboard nav + focus ring visible + AA contrast
- [ ] Responsive at 360/768/1024/1280
- [ ] Types pass (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Lint clean (`npm run lint`)

---

## Constraints

1. Frontend-only scope - no real auth backend
2. No breaking changes to mock API
3. QDS compliance (tokens, spacing, radius, shadows)
4. Type safety (no `any`)
5. Component reusability (props-driven)
6. Preserve existing thread/post functionality

## Decisions

### Type Safety Guardian (2025-10-04)
**Dashboard Type System:** Designed comprehensive type system using discriminated unions for role-based dashboard data. `DashboardData` type splits into `StudentDashboardData` | `InstructorDashboardData` with `role` discriminator. Added `ActivityItem` union for activity feed with 5 activity types. Created `EnrichedCourse` compositions (`CourseWithMetrics` | `CourseWithActivity`) for role-specific course data. Implemented 12 type guards for runtime safety. Zero `any` types, all strict mode compliant.

- Plan: `/Users/dgz/projects-professional/quokka/quokka-demo/doccloud/tasks/auth-dashboard-system/plans/dashboard-type-design.md`

### Mock API Designer (2025-10-04)
**Dashboard API Aggregation:** Designed aggregate API methods (`getStudentDashboard`, `getInstructorDashboard`) reducing 3+ separate calls to 1 optimized call. Student dashboard fetches enrollments + recent activity + notifications in 200-400ms. Instructor dashboard aggregates courses + metrics + unanswered queue + insights in 300-500ms. React Query hooks use role-based enablement, 2-3min stale time, smart invalidation on mutations. Achieves 67-75% fewer API calls vs individual fetches.

- Plan: `/Users/dgz/projects-professional/quokka/quokka-demo/doccloud/tasks/auth-dashboard-system/plans/dashboard-api-design.md`

### Component Architect (2025-10-04)
**Floating Quokka AI Agent:** Designed 3-component system (`FloatingQuokka` container, `QuokkaButton` minimized state, `QuokkaChatWindow` expanded state) for course-context AI assistant. Bottom-right positioning (desktop 350x500px, mobile full-screen). Three states (hidden/minimized/expanded) with localStorage persistence. Course-aware quick prompts + AI responses using existing keyword logic. Focus trap, Escape key handler, ARIA dialog pattern. Glass panel styling, 250-300ms animations, reduced motion support. Reuses message bubbles from `/app/quokka/page.tsx`, integrates with course detail page via props-driven design.

- Plan: `/Users/dgz/projects-professional/quokka/quokka-demo/doccloud/tasks/auth-dashboard-system/plans/floating-ai-agent-design.md`

### Component Architect (2025-10-04)
**Dashboard Component Architecture:** Designed 14-component role-based dashboard system reusing existing patterns. Student dashboard: CourseCard + ActivityFeed + NotificationList. Instructor dashboard: CourseCard with inline metrics + UnansweredQueue + InsightsPanel + MetricsOverview. Shared components accept role prop for variant rendering. Three-tier layout: router (`/dashboard`) → role page (`/student` or `/instructor`) → specialized components. Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns), glass morphism styling, skeleton loaders, empty states. All data via React Query hooks (no direct API). Props-driven design, zero hardcoded values, QDS token compliance. Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA landmarks, keyboard nav, 4.5:1 contrast.

## Risks & Rollback

**Risks:**
- Major routing changes could break existing functionality
- Floating AI agent UX might be intrusive
- Role-based views could create code duplication

**Rollback:**
- Keep existing `/ask` and `/quokka` routes as fallbacks
- Make floating agent dismissable/toggleable
- Use shared components with role-based props

### Architecture Decisions

**Role-Based Routing:**
```
/ → /login (if not auth'd) → /dashboard
    ↓
    Student dashboard (shows enrolled courses, activity)
    OR
    Instructor dashboard (shows managed courses, metrics)
    ↓
/courses → /courses/[id]
           ↓
           Course detail with:
           - Collapsible Ask Question form
           - Floating Quokka AI agent (bottom-right)
           - Discussion threads list
```

**Data Flow:**
- Single aggregated API call per dashboard (vs 3-5 separate calls)
- React Query caching with 2-3 minute stale time
- Smart invalidation on mutations
- Props-driven components (no hardcoded values)

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
app/dashboard/page.tsx
├─ StudentDashboard (inline component)
│  ├─ Stats cards (4)
│  ├─ Course grid (CourseWithActivity)
│  └─ Activity feed (ActivityItem[])
└─ InstructorDashboard (inline component)
   ├─ Stats cards (4)
   ├─ Managed courses grid (CourseWithMetrics)
   └─ Unanswered queue (Thread[])

app/courses/[courseId]/page.tsx
├─ Course hero (breadcrumb, title, description, stats)
├─ Ask Question form (collapsible)
├─ Discussion threads list
└─ FloatingQuokka (fixed bottom-right)
```

### Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (role-based dashboard router + inline components)
- `components/course/floating-quokka.tsx` (AI agent)
- `doccloud/tasks/auth-dashboard-system/` (task context, research, plans)

**Modified:**
- `lib/models/types.ts` (+105 lines: dashboard types)
- `lib/api/client.ts` (+257 lines: dashboard API methods)
- `lib/api/hooks.ts` (+19 lines: dashboard hooks + invalidation)
- `app/page.tsx` (redirect to /dashboard)
- `app/courses/[courseId]/page.tsx` (+145 lines: Ask Question form + FloatingQuokka integration)
- `components/layout/nav-header.tsx` (Dashboard nav, removed Ask/AI Chat)

### User Flows

**Student Flow:**
1. Login → Student Dashboard (courses, activity, stats)
2. Click course → Course detail page
3. Click "Ask Question" → Inline form expands
4. Fill form → Submit → Redirects to new thread
5. Click Quokka button (bottom-right) → Chat expands
6. Ask course-specific question → Get AI response

**Instructor Flow:**
1. Login → Instructor Dashboard (courses, metrics, unanswered queue)
2. Click unanswered thread → View thread detail
3. Click course → Course detail page (same as student)
4. See metrics inline in course cards
5. Use Quokka for quick reference (same as student)

### Known Limitations

- Floating Quokka uses keyword-based AI (not real LLM)
- Dashboard insights are mock-generated (would be AI in production)
- Session state not persisted (message history clears on page reload)
- Global `/ask` and `/quokka` routes still exist (deprecated but functional)

### Next Steps (if needed)

- [ ] Launch QDS Compliance Auditor for final audit
- [ ] Launch Accessibility Validator for WCAG 2.2 AA audit
- [ ] Add TA-specific dashboard (currently uses instructor dashboard)
- [ ] Implement real AI backend for Quokka
- [ ] Add course analytics charts for instructor dashboard
- [ ] Persist Quokka message history to localStorage

- `2025-10-04` | [Planning] | Created task context and launched planning agents
