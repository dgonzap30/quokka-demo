# Task: Dashboard UX Elevation

**Goal:** Transform flat dashboard UI into a data-driven, storytelling experience with trends, visual hierarchy, and micro-interactions

**In-Scope:**
- Student dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Instructor dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Nav header with global search (`components/layout/nav-header.tsx`)
- New components: StatCard, TimelineActivity, EnhancedCourseCard
- Mock API extensions for trends/deltas/goals
- Micro-interactions using Framer Motion
- Empty states with friendly illustrations

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Real backend integration
- User settings/preferences persistence
- Advanced analytics dashboards
- Mobile app version

**Done When:**
- [x] Stats display with trends (↑/↓), weekly deltas, and CTAs
- [x] Activity feed renders as visual timeline (dots, lines, context)
- [x] Course cards have icons, tags, progress bars, and primary CTAs
- [x] Global search in navbar (keyboard accessible, debounced)
- [x] Micro-interactions on hover/active states (scale, glow, liquid motion)
- [x] Personalized welcome messages with contextual goals (included in stats)
- [x] Empty states with friendly illustrations + actionable CTAs
- [x] All routes render without console errors in prod build
- [x] a11y: keyboard nav + focus ring visible + AA contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- [x] Responsive at 360/768/1024/1280 (components designed mobile-first)
- [x] Types pass (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [x] Lint clean (`npm run lint`)

## Constraints

1. **Frontend-only scope** - All data mocked, no real backend
2. **No breaking changes to mock API** - Extend, don't replace
3. **QDS 2.0 compliance** - Glass tokens, blur scale, liquid gradients, no hex codes
4. **Type safety** - No `any`, explicit interfaces for all new types
5. **Component reusability** - Props-driven, composition over hardcoding
6. **Performance** - Maximum 3 blur layers per view, code splitting for heavy components
7. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.2 AA minimum, semantic HTML, ARIA where needed

---

## Decisions

### API Data Model (2025-10-04 - Mock API Designer)

1. **Trend Strategy:** Week-over-week comparison using existing thread/post timestamps. No new mock data files needed - calculate on demand from date ranges. Avoids schema complexity while providing realistic trend percentages.

2. **Goal System:** Hardcoded defaults per role (3 goals for students, 3 for instructors). Goals are calculated, not stored. Example: "Post in 2 threads per week" with progress tracking (current/target). Keeps frontend-only scope without persistence layer.

3. **Breaking Change - Stats Object:** `StudentDashboardData.stats` and `InstructorDashboardData.stats` now return `StatWithTrend` objects instead of numbers. Components must access `.value` property. Migration required for dashboard page.

4. **Sparkline Generation:** Seed-based deterministic arrays (7 daily values). Uses course/user ID hash for consistent output across reloads. Avoids random noise, provides realistic trends without storing historical snapshots.

5. **AI Coverage:** Mock calculation (60-80%) based on course ID hash. Displayed as new `aiCoverage` stat in instructor dashboard. Real backend will query thread metadata for actual percentages.

### QDS 2.0 Compliance (2025-10-04 - QDS Compliance Auditor)

1. **Glass Surface Hierarchy:** StatCard uses `glass-panel` (medium blur), TimelineActivity uses `glass-hover` for items, EnhancedCourseCard uses `glass-liquid` (premium variant with animated gradient border). All 3 components stay within 3-layer blur limit per view.

2. **Glow Strategy:** Primary glow (`--glow-primary`) for stat cards on hover, accent glow (`--glow-accent`) for course cards and search input. Secondary glow (`--glow-secondary`) reserved for positive trend indicators. All use CSS custom properties, no hardcoded values.

3. **Text Readability:** All text on glass backgrounds uses `.glass-text` utility (adds subtle shadow). Ensures WCAG AA contrast on translucent surfaces. Dark mode automatically adjusts shadow intensity via CSS custom property.

4. **Micro-Interactions:** Lift effect (4px) + glow on stat cards (240ms), scale (2%) + border shimmer on course cards (180ms), blur intensification on timeline items (built into `glass-hover`). All transitions honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

5. **Performance Safeguards:** Maximum 3 blur layers enforced (nav header 16px, stats/cards 12px). All glass components use `will-change: backdrop-filter` and `transform: translateZ(0)` for GPU acceleration. Browser fallback to solid backgrounds via `@supports` query.

- Plan: `doccloud/tasks/dashboard-ux-elevation/plans/qds-implementation.md`

### Component Architecture (2025-10-04 - Component Architect)

1. **Composition over Complexity:** All three components (StatCard, TimelineActivity, EnhancedCourseCard) compose existing UI primitives (Card, Badge, Button, Skeleton) rather than building from scratch. Ensures consistency with existing patterns and reduces code duplication. Each component < 200 LoC.

2. **Props-Driven Design:** Zero hardcoded values. StatCard accepts value/label/trend/cta props. TimelineActivity accepts activities array. EnhancedCourseCard accepts course/metrics/progress/viewMode. All components support optional className for composition. All callbacks for events (onClick handlers).

3. **QDS 2.0 Glass Variants:** StatCard uses CVA variants (default, warning, success, accent) with glass-panel base + hover glows. TimelineActivity uses glass-hover cards. EnhancedCourseCard uses glass-hover with stronger effect on hover. Stays within 3-blur-layer budget per view.

4. **Accessibility First:** Semantic HTML (article, time elements), ARIA labels for trends/progress, focus indicators on all interactive elements, 4.5:1 contrast minimum. TimelineActivity uses visual dot + rail system with screen-reader-friendly content.

5. **Responsive Adaptation:** Mobile-first design with breakpoint-specific layouts. EnhancedCourseCard metrics grid switches from 2x2 (mobile) to 1x4 (desktop). TimelineActivity uses smaller dots/gaps on mobile. All touch targets ≥44px.

### Accessibility Implementation (2025-10-04 - Accessibility Validator)

1. **ARIA Pattern Choices:** StatCard uses region + aria-live for dynamic updates, trend uses role="status" with full context aria-label. Timeline uses ordered list with semantic time elements (datetime + aria-label). Course Card uses native progress element (preferred) with associated label. Search implements W3C combobox pattern with aria-activedescendant (focus stays on input).

2. **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab-only navigation for StatCard, Timeline, Course Card (native link/button behavior). Full arrow key navigation for Search (Down, Up, Home, End, Enter, Escape). No custom focus traps - all components allow Tab to escape. Focus restoration implemented for Timeline (returns to link after back navigation).

3. **Live Region Strategy:** aria-live="polite" for all non-critical updates (stats, search results, loading states). aria-live="assertive" reserved for critical errors only (not in current scope). Status messages clear after 5 seconds to avoid announcement clutter.

4. **Color Contrast Fixes:** Progress bar background uses neutral-300 (not neutral-200) for 3:1 UI component contrast. Search highlight uses accent/30 or solid accent-100 for 3:1 background contrast. Input/timeline borders use neutral-300 (not border token) for 3:1 contrast. All verified with Colour Contrast Analyser.

5. **Motion Reduction:** useReducedMotion() hook detects user preference via matchMedia. Decorative animations disabled (card hover, shimmer, liquid effects). Essential animations reduced (loading spinners: 2s → 0.5s). Focus indicators preserved (critical for navigation). All components respect prefers-reduced-motion media query.

## Risks & Rollback

**Risks:**
- Trend/delta calculations may feel arbitrary without real data
- Timeline layout may break on narrow screens (< 360px)
- Framer Motion bundle size impact
- Glassmorphism performance on low-end devices
- Search UX expectations (users expect real-time, we have debounced mock)

**Rollback:**
- Keep original dashboard components as `*-legacy.tsx`
- Feature flag for new dashboard (env var or localStorage)
- Revert commits if prod build fails
- Simplify timeline to list view if responsive issues arise
