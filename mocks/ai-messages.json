Start with brute force:**\n\"I can solve this in O(n²) with nested loops. Let me code that first, then we can optimize.\"\n\n**3. Ask clarifying questions:**\n- \"Can I assume the array is sorted?\"\n- \"What should I return for empty input?\"\n- \"Are there memory constraints?\"\n\n**4. Work through an example:**\nWrite out input → output on whiteboard\n\n**5. If truly stuck, ask for a hint:**\n\"I'm stuck on how to avoid the O(n²) solution. Can you give me a hint?\"\n\n**Don't do this:**\n- ❌ Stay silent for 5 minutes\n- ❌ Give up immediately\n- ❌ Make excuses\n\n**Remember:** Interviews test problem-solving, not memorization. Show you can work through ambiguity!",
