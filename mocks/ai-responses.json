      "text": "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.\n\nBasic syntax:\n```python\n[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n```\n\nExamples:\n```python\n# Square numbers\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n\n# Filter even numbers\nevens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]\n\n# Transform strings\nupper = [s.upper() for s in ['hello', 'world']]\n```\n\nUse them when:\n- Creating new lists from existing iterables\n- You need a simple transformation/filter\n- The logic fits in one readable line\n\nAvoid when:\n- The logic is complex (use regular for loops)\n- You need multiple statements",

      "text": "The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously.\n\nKey impacts:\n- **CPU-bound programs**: Only one thread executes Python code at a time, so multi-threading won't speed up CPU-intensive tasks\n- **I/O-bound programs**: The GIL is released during I/O operations, so threading works well for network/disk operations\n\nAlternatives for CPU-bound parallelism:\n- **multiprocessing**: Use separate processes instead of threads\n- **asyncio**: For I/O-bound concurrent operations\n- **C extensions**: Can release the GIL during compute-heavy operations\n\nExample:\n```python\n# For CPU-bound: use multiprocessing\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nwith Pool(4) as p:\n    results = p.map(cpu_intensive_func, data)\n\n# For I/O-bound: threading works fine\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:\n    results = executor.map(fetch_url, urls)\n```",
