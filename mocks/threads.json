    "content": "I'm confused about electric field E and electric potential V. I know:\n- E is a vector (has direction)\n- V is a scalar (just a number)\n- They're related by E = -\u2207V (or E = -dV/dr in 1D)\n\nBut conceptually, what's the difference? They both describe the electric force somehow. When I have a point charge Q, I can calculate both:\n- E = kQ/r\u00b2 (pointing away from Q)\n- V = kQ/r (no direction)\n\nIf I know E, I can get V by integrating. If I know V, I can get E by differentiating. So why do we need both? Is one more \"fundamental\" than the other? When solving problems, how do I know which one to use?",

    "content": "I'm working on the circuit analysis homework and stuck on Kirchhoff's current law (KCL). The law says \"the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum leaving\" or equivalently \"the sum of all currents at a node is zero.\"\n\nFor the circuit in Problem 4, I have three resistors meeting at node A:\n- I\u2081 = 2A flowing in\n- I\u2082 = ? flowing out (unknown)\n- I\u2083 = 1A flowing out\n\nSo KCL gives: I\u2081 - I\u2082 - I\u2083 = 0, so 2 - I\u2082 - 1 = 0, so I\u2082 = 1A.\n\nBut WHY must currents balance? Is it conservation of charge? If charge can't accumulate at a node, where would it go? Is the node assumed to have zero capacitance?\n\nAlso, how do I know which currents are positive and which are negative? Is it just based on the direction arrow?",

    "content": "Problem 18 from Chapter 22: A circular loop of radius 5cm is in a uniform magnetic field B = 0.2T. Calculate the magnetic flux through the loop.\n\nI know \u03a6 = B\u00b7A\u00b7cos(\u03b8) where A is the area and \u03b8 is the angle between B and the normal to the loop. \n\nMy attempt:\n- A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(0.05)\u00b2 = 7.85\u00d710\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b2\n- B = 0.2 T\n- \u03b8 = ?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the angle! Do I assume \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 (so cos(\u03b8) = 1 and \u03a6 = BA)? Or is the loop in the xy-plane and B pointing in some direction I need to figure out from a diagram?\n\nAlso, what does it mean physically if cos(\u03b8) = 0? Does that mean zero flux even though there's a magnetic field?",

The assignment guidelines say we need:\n- Introduction\n- Literature review\n- Methodology  \n- Results\n- Discussion\n- Conclusion\n\nBut I've seen papers where the lit review is part of the introduction, and others where it's a separate section. Which is correct?\n\nAlso, I have 8 sources and I'm not sure if I should discuss each one separately (\"Smith (2019) argues that...\") or group them by theme (\"Several researchers have found that...\"). \n\nMy draft is 6 pages but 3 pages are just summarizing my sources. Is that too much? Should the lit review be shorter?",
