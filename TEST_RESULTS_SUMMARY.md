# QuokkaQ Application Testing Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-20 to 2025-10-21
**Tester**: Claude (Playwright MCP)
**Test Duration**: ~90 minutes (2 sessions)

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive end-to-end testing of the QuokkaQ full-stack application verified **successful integration** between the Next.js frontend and Fastify backend. All critical user flows work correctly, with proper data persistence to the SQLite database.

### Overall Result: ✅ **PASS** (with minor issues noted)

---

## Pre-Test Fixes

### 1. Backend Thread Schema Validation Error ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Threads API endpoint returning 500 errors due to `views` field validation
- **Root Cause**: Drizzle ORM returns `view_count` (snake_case) but Zod schema expects `views`
- **Fix**: Updated `threads.repository.ts` to handle both `viewCount` and `view_count` fields
- **Files Changed**: `backend/src/repositories/threads.repository.ts:169-170, 235-236`
- **Commit**: `6b4bb0e`

### 2. Frontend API Chat Route (Already Fixed)
- **Status**: No issues found
- **Verified**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` correctly uses `result.toUIMessageStreamResponse()`

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Test 1: User Authentication & Login
**Status**: PASS

**What Was Tested**:
- Automatic user authentication on page load
- User session persistence

### ⚠️ Test 4: AI Question Preview ("Ask Quokka" Button)
**Status**: PARTIAL (Feature exists but not fully tested)

**What Was Tested**:
- "Ask Quokka" button availability
- Button state (enabled when content filled)

**Results**:
- ✅ Button becomes enabled when question content is entered

- ✅ Action buttons available: Copy and Retry
- ✅ Message history persists in chat
- ✅ Character counter works (49/50 characters)

**Evidence**: Screenshot `08-ai-chat-code-formatting.png`

**Note**: No citations displayed because this was a general programming question without course-specific material references. Citations would appear when using `kb_search` or `kb_fetch` tools with course materials.

---

### ✅ Test 6: Student Dashboard Backend Integration
**Status**: PASS (After Bug Fix)

**What Was Tested**:
- Student dashboard course enrollment display
- Backend API integration for `/api/v1/courses/enrollments`
- Dashboard statistics accuracy

**Issue Found**:
- **Bug**: Dashboard showed "No Courses Yet" despite 2 enrollments in database
- **Root Cause**: `getStudentDashboard()` in `lib/api/client/instructor.ts` did not check `BACKEND_FEATURE_FLAGS.instructor`
- **Impact**: Used localStorage (empty) instead of backend API

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `getStudentDashboard()` to check backend feature flags
- Integrated `/api/v1/courses/enrollments` endpoint
- Transformed backend response to `CourseWithActivity` format
- Maintained localStorage fallback

**Results After Fix**:
- ✅ Dashboard now displays 2 courses (CS 201, PHYS 201)
- ✅ Backend API called correctly: `GET /api/v1/courses/enrollments?userId=user-student-1`
- ✅ Console log confirms: "[Instructor API] getStudentDashboard using BACKEND enrollments: 2 courses"
- ✅ Dashboard statistics updated: Courses = 2 (was 0)
- ✅ Course cards display correctly with metadata

**Files Changed**: `lib/api/client/instructor.ts` (lines 91-345)
**Commit**: `dac56af` - "fix: integrate backend enrollments API in student dashboard"
**Evidence**: Screenshot `07-dashboard-backend-fixed.png`

### ✅ Test 7: Thread Replies and Database Persistence
**Status**: PASS

**What Was Tested**:
- Reply textarea functionality
- Reply submission to backend
- Database persistence verification
- UI updates after posting
- View count tracking

**Form Data**:
- **Reply Content**: Test cases for merge sort (empty array, single element, sorted, reverse, duplicates)
- **Thread ID**: `faea1ace-86bb-49f7-bab3-eb58233a90b6` (merge sort thread)

**Results**:
- ✅ Reply textarea accepts input
- ✅ Post Reply button enables when content entered
- ✅ Reply posted successfully
- ✅ Heading updated: "0 Replies" → "1 Reply"
- ✅ Reply displayed with timestamp: "10/20/2025, 9:39:06 PM"
- ✅ Form cleared after submission
- ✅ View count incremented: 2 → 3 views

**Database Verification**:
```sql
SELECT id, content, author_id, thread_id, created_at
FROM posts
WHERE thread_id = 'faea1ace-86bb-49f7-bab3-eb58233a90b6'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

Result:

Great question! For testing merge sort, you should definitely cover these cases:
1. Empty array: []
2. Single element: [5]
3. Already sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
4. Reverse sorted: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
5. Duplicates: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
Your implementation looks correct to me! |

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. Duplicate Check Endpoint Not Implemented
- **Error**: `HTTP 404` on `/api/v1/threads/check-duplicates`
- **Impact**: Low - Question posting still works
- **Recommendation**: Implement duplicate detection endpoint or disable frontend call

#### 2. AI Answer Generation Timing
- **Error**: "Thread not found" when AI tries to generate answer immediately
- **Root Cause**: Race condition - AI generation starts before thread fully persisted
- **Impact**: Low - AI answers can be generated later
- **Recommendation**: Add delay or use event-driven approach for AI generation

#### 3. Student Dashboard Not Using Backend API ✅ **FIXED**
- **Observation**: Student dashboard showed "No Courses Yet" despite enrollments existing in database
- **Root Cause**: `getStudentDashboard()` in `lib/api/client/instructor.ts` did NOT check `BACKEND_FEATURE_FLAGS.instructor`
  - Backend had enrollment data: `GET /api/v1/courses/enrollments?userId=user-student-1` returns 2 courses
  - Frontend was using localStorage: `getEnrollments(userId)` from `localStore.ts` returned empty array
  - localStorage was empty (never seeded): `localStorage.getItem('quokkaQ_enrollments')` = null
- **Impact**: **HIGH** - Caused inconsistent behavior across the app
  - Student dashboard: Showed "No Courses" (localStorage)
  - Course pages: Worked correctly (backend API)
  - This explained user's report of "different states in which courses don't show up and some in which they do"
- **Fix Applied** (See Test 6 above):
  - Updated `getStudentDashboard()` to check `BACKEND_FEATURE_FLAGS.instructor`
  - Integrated `/api/v1/courses/enrollments` endpoint
  - Transformed backend response to `CourseWithActivity` format
  - Maintained localStorage fallback for backward compatibility
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Dashboard now displays 2 courses correctly
- **Commit**: `dac56af` - "fix: integrate backend enrollments API in student dashboard"

## Features NOT Tested (Out of Scope)

The following features were not fully tested:

1. ⚠️ **Conversation to Thread Conversion** - Feature UI element not found
   - Conversation actions menu only shows "Clear Conversation"
   - No "Convert to Thread" option visible
   - May require course-specific context or additional messages
   - **Recommendation**: Verify if feature is implemented or if UI is incomplete

2. **Thread Endorsements** - Thread upvoting and instructor endorsement
   - Not tested due to time constraints
   - Backend endpoint `/api/v1/threads/{id}/upvote` likely exists

3. **AI Assistant with Course Materials** - Testing RAG tools (kb_search, kb_fetch)
   - Only tested general questions without course-specific context
   - Citations feature not verified (requires course material references)

4. **Instructor Dashboard** - Metrics panel, moderation queue
   - Not accessed during testing (logged in as student)

---

## Data Persistence Verification

### ✅ SQLite Database (backend/dev.db)

**Verified Tables**:
- ✅ `users` - User authentication data persists
- ✅ `threads` - New thread successfully written and retrieved
- ✅ `posts` - New reply successfully written and retrieved
- ✅ `courses` - Course data available
- ✅ `enrollments` - User course enrollments persist
